            question: "What is a Text to Hex Converter?",
            answer: "A Text to Hex converter transforms plain text characters into their hexadecimal (base-16) representations, commonly used in computing and digital encoding."
        },
        {
            question: "How does the Text to Hex conversion work?",
            answer: "The converter reads each character in the text, converts it to its ASCII value, and then converts that value into hexadecimal format."
        },
        {
            question: "Why would I need to convert text to hex?",
            answer: "Text to hex conversion is often used for data encoding, cryptography, debugging, and transferring non-printable characters in computing environments."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I convert hex back to text?",
            answer: "Yes, you can easily reverse the conversion by using a Hex to Text converter. The original text will be recovered from the hex representation."
        },
        {
            question: "Are special characters and spaces included in the conversion?",
            answer: "Yes, the converter handles all characters, including spaces and special symbols. Each will be converted into their corresponding hexadecimal value."
