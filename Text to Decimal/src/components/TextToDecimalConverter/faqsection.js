            question: "What is the process of converting text to decimal format?",
            answer: "Converting text to decimal involves taking each character of the text and converting it to its corresponding ASCII (or Unicode) code, which is represented as a decimal number."
        },
        {
            question: "Why would you need to convert text to decimal?",
            answer: "Text is often converted to decimal for data encoding, encryption, or storage purposes, as decimal numbers can be processed more easily by computers."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the role of Unicode in text-to-decimal conversions?",
            answer: "Unicode provides a universal mapping of characters to numeric values, supporting a wide range of characters across different languages, making it ideal for converting text to decimal in a globally compatible way. "
        },
        {
            question: "Can all types of text be converted into decimal values?",
            answer: "Yes, all text can be converted to decimal as long as it is encoded in a format like ASCII or Unicode, which maps characters to numeric codes."
