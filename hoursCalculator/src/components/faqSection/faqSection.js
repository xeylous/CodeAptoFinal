            question: "How do I calculate the difference between two times?",
            answer: "To calculate the difference between two times, input the start and end dates, along with their respective times (AM/PM format). Then, click the Calculate button to see the result."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the 'Now' button used for?",
            answer: "The 'Now' button automatically sets the current date and time in the start or end fields, making it easier to calculate time differences from the present moment."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I calculate the time difference between two different dates?",
            answer: "Yes, you can calculate the time difference between two different dates by selecting the appropriate start and end dates and times."
        },
        {
            question: "What format should I use for inputting time?",
            answer: "Input time in the 12-hour format (HH) and select either AM or PM from the dropdown."
        },
        {
            question: "What happens if the end time is earlier than the start time?",
            answer: "If the end time is earlier than the start time, the calculator will set the hours difference to 0, ensuring that no negative results are shown."
