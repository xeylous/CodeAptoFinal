            question: "What is a hosting checker?",
            answer: "A hosting checker is a tool that helps you identify which company or server is hosting a particular domain. It provides details like the hosting provider, IP address, and nameservers."
        },
        {
            question: "How do I find out who is hosting my website?",
            answer: "Simply enter your website's domain name into the hosting checker, and it will display details about your hosting provider, including IP address and DNS information."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the difference between a domain name and a host?",
            answer: "A domain name is the web address that users type to access your site (e.g., example.com), while a host refers to the server where your website files are stored and served to users."
        },
        {
            question: "What are nameservers and why are they important?",
            answer: "Nameservers are servers that translate your domain name into an IP address, helping direct traffic to the correct server. They play a crucial role in ensuring your website is reachable on the internet."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I change my hosting provider without changing my domain?",
            answer: "Yes, you can change your hosting provider while keeping your domain name. You would need to update your domain's nameservers to point to your new hosting provider."
