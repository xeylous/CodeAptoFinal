            question: " How does the decimal number system differ from the binary system?",
            answer: " The decimal system uses ten digits (0-9) and is based on powers of 10, while the binary system uses only two digits (0 and 1) and is based on powers of 2. "

        {
            question: " What is the significance of base 2 in binary conversion? ",
            answer: " Base 2 means that each digit in the binary system represents a power of 2, just as each digit in the decimal system represents a power of 10."
        },
        {
            question: " How does binary represent negative decimal numbers? ",
            answer: "  Negative decimal numbers are represented in binary using methods like two's complement, where the most significant bit (MSB) indicates the sign (0 for positive, 1 for negative). "
        },
        {
            question: " Can you convert large decimal numbers to binary? ",
            answer: "  Yes, large decimal numbers can be converted to binary using the same method of dividing by 2 and recording remainders, although for very large numbers, automated tools or programming methods are preferred. "
