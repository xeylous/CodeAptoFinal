            question: "How can ASCII to binary conversion be useful in data encoding and transmission? ",
            answer: "ASCII to binary conversion is crucial for encoding data in digital formats like files, protocols, and networks. Binary data is more efficient for computers to process and can be compressed or encrypted for secure transmission. "

        {
            question: "Why is ASCII to binary conversion important in programming?",
            answer: "ASCII to binary conversion is crucial because computers store and process data in binary. Converting ASCII to binary allows computers to handle textual data for tasks like file storage, network transmission, and encoding."

        {
            question: "How does converting ASCII to binary work in digital communications?",
            answer: " In digital communications, textual data is converted from ASCII to binary so that it can be transmitted over digital channels, as these systems primarily process binary data."
