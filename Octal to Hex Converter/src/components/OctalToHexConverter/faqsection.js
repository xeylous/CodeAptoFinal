            question: "Why do we need to convert octal to hexadecimal?",
            answer: "Octal and hexadecimal are both used in computing to simplify binary representation. Converting between them is useful in understanding different systems or formats, especially when dealing with low-level programming and digital systems."
        },
        {
            question: "What are the steps to convert octal to binary before converting to hexadecimal?",
            answer: "Each octal digit converts to a 3-bit binary equivalent. After converting the entire octal number to binary, group the binary digits into sets of four and convert them into hexadecimal."
        },
        {
            question: "Can you convert fractional octal numbers to hexadecimal?",
            answer: "Yes, fractional octal numbers can be converted to binary (each digit after the decimal point is still represented by 3 bits), and then the binary is grouped and converted to hexadecimal. "
        },
        {
            question: "What is octal, and how is it different from hexadecimal?",
            answer: " Octal is a base-8 numbering system, using digits 0-7, while hexadecimal is base-16, using digits 0-9 and letters A-F to represent values 10-15."
