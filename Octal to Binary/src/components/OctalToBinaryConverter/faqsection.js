            question: "What are the key steps to convert binary to octal?",
            answer: "To convert binary to octal group the binary digits into sets of three (starting from the right) and convert each group to its octal equivalent."
        },
        {
            question: "How do you convert an octal fraction  into binary?",
            answer: "Convert the whole part of the octal number as usual, then convert the fractional part by multiplying each octal digit after the point by powers of 8, converting the result into binary. "
        },
        {
            question: "Can all octal numbers be converted into binary?",
            answer: " Yes, all octal numbers can be precisely converted into binary, as octal and binary are both positional number systems."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the relationship between octal and binary in computing?",
            answer: "Octal provides a more compact way to represent binary numbers. It is often used in computing for permissions (e.g., in Unix file systems) and representing binary data more succinctly."
