            question: "Why do we convert hexadecimal to binary or decimal?",
            answer: "Converting between these systems makes it easier to interpret and manipulate data, as computers process data in binary but humans often use hexadecimal and decimal for readability. "
        },
        {
            question: "What is the importance of converting hex to binary in computing?",
            answer: " Hex simplifies the representation of long binary numbers, which are essential in computing for addressing memory, defining colors in graphics, and encoding instructions in machine language."
        },
        {
            question: "Can you explain the relationship between hexadecimal and binary?",
            answer: " Hexadecimal is a compact representation of binary because each hex digit corresponds exactly to four binary digits (bits), making conversions between the two straightforward. "
        },
        {
            question: "How do you convert hexadecimal to decimal manually?",
            answer: "To convert hex to decimal, multiply each hex digit by 16 raised to the power of its position (starting from 0) and sum the results."
