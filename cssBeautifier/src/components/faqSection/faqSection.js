            question: "What is a CSS Beautifier?",
            answer: "A CSS Beautifier is a tool that formats your CSS code to make it more readable. It adds proper indentation, organizes properties, and places each rule on a separate line. This makes the CSS easier to understand and maintain."
        },
        {
            question: "How do I use this CSS Beautifier?",
            answer: "Simply paste your CSS code into the Paste your CSS here text area, then click the Beautify CSS button. You can also upload a .css file by clicking the File button. The beautified CSS will appear in the Beautified CSS section, and you can download, copy, or clear the result using the respective buttons."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I download the beautified CSS file?",
            answer: "Yes, after beautifying your CSS, you can click the Download button to save the beautified CSS code as a .css file on your device."
        },
        {
            question: "What should I do if my CSS code doesn't get beautified correctly?",
            answer: "If your CSS isn't beautified as expected, double-check that the CSS is valid and complete. If the tool encounters an issue, it will show an error message. Ensure that there are no syntax errors in your input."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I use this tool to upload and beautify large CSS files?",
            answer: "Yes, you can upload and beautify large CSS files using the File button. However, for extremely large files, processing might take a few moments depending on the size of the file."
